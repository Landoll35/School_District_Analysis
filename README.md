# School_District_Analysis

Looking over the data, a few things stand out to me. It appears that while reading scores are relatively consistent across the board, the math scores are better overall at the charter schools until grade 12. Charter schools seem to be teaching more with less of a budget. I would be interested in showing the math scores by school and grade to paint a better overall picture of where the discrepencies lie. There will also be outside factors contributing to these dicrepencies, of course, but those factors will be easier to identify once the data has been drilled into a little bit further.
